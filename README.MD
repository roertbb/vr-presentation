# VR Presentation

During our English classes my friend Bartek and I were meant to prepare presentation about something connected with it. Instead of diving deeply into some research papers, we've had fun messing around with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) and some [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/).
